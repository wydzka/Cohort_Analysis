# Cohort_Analysis
In this analysis, we aim to understand customer behavior over time in the store_bike dataset. This is a highly useful tool for understanding how different customers behave and how they change over time when making purchases in our business, which can help the business make data-driven decisions about customer acquisition, retention, and engagement.
